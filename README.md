## How to Use the Program

Open the code and put the cipher text in the codeString variable.

Now run the code and the frequency of each letter in the cipher will be printed.

## To replace certain letters

Upon running the program, write your input in the form of "Letter to replace-Letter to replace with"

For example, to replace each instance of the letter L in 'Hello' with E, the input will be "L-E"

## Tips

write 'quit' to quit the program, or 'restart' to return cipher to original form.
